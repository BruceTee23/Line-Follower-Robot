1. Connect the L293D motor shield to your Arduino Board by fitting the pins in the connection space.
2. Wire the battery holder to the L293D with the switch between the connections on the positive side and negative to negative.
3. Connect the 2 motors on either M1, M2, M3, or M4 depends on your reference. In this case, I am connecting it to M2 and M3 for better organizing things. Make sure that they are running in the direction you wanted.
4. Connect IR sensor to the L293D through this guide: (Out -> A0-5, GND -> GND, VCC -> +5)
5. Connect your Arduino to your computer using USB A/B head cable
